Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churn in a music streaming service using data from the past three months. The goal is to enable proactive strategies to enhance customer retention.

Purpose
To predict potential churn risks early, allowing for effective interventions to reduce subscription cancellations and stabilize the customer base.

Project Scope
Data Utilization: Analyzing subscription details and listening history.
Model Development: Employing supervised learning techniques.
Implementation: Integrating the model into the CRM system.

Business Context
Increasing subscription cancellations negatively impact revenue and customer base stability. This project addresses this issue by predicting churn to inform retention strategies.

Research Questions
What behaviors suggest a high risk of churn?
Which variables are strong predictors of churn?

Observations and Recommendations
Discounts and Churn: Discounts correlate with churn, suggesting they are often reactively given to dissatisfied customers.
Engagement and Retention: More frequent use correlates with lower churn rates.
Content Satisfaction: High consumption of pop music correlates with churn, suggesting content issues.

Recommendations
Refine Discount Strategy: Target discounts based on predictive churn risks.
